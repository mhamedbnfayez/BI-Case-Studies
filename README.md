# Business Intelligence Case Studies

This repository showcases my Business Intelligence (BI) proficiency through various case studies. Each project delves into a specific domain, leveraging data analysis techniques and powerful tools to uncover valuable insights that inform strategic decision-making.

## Key Highlights:
- Diverse Case Studies: Explore a range of scenarios demonstrating the versatility of BI approaches across different industries (replace with specific industries or data types if applicable).
- In-Depth Analyses: Dive deeper into individual projects to understand the problem statements, methodologies employed, and key findings derived from data.
- Power BI Expertise: Witness the application of Power BI as the primary tool for data exploration, visualization, and model building.
- Continuous Learning: This repository reflects my ongoing commitment to expanding my BI skillset and staying informed about best practices.

## Project Navigation:
Each folder within this repository represents an individual BI case study. Within each folder, you'll typically find the following files (if applicable):
- Power BI Report (.pbix): The main Power BI report file containing the visualizations and analysis.
- Data Files (.csv, .xlsx, etc.): The raw data used in the analysis. (Consider data privacy and anonymization if applicable)
- Documentation (.txt, .md): Additional details and insights related to the case study.
